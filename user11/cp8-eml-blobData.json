The country seems to be at political unrest. So travelling there is not a safe option.\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tMacedonia- On Sep 11 the country was hit by earthquake of 5.3 magnitude injuring 30 people. Except that, everything looks fine. So we may consider travelling to Macedonia.\r\n\r\n\tAlbania- The country is not at war with any US ally. On political fronts its calm. It’s safe to travel there in my opinion.\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tI hope it helps.\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tRegards,\r\n\r\n\tElizabeth\r\n\r\n\tFrom: Davos Stark [mailto:davos.stark@oregonstate.edu] \r\n\tSent: Tuesday, September 13, 2016 3:38 PM\r\n\tTo: Eveland, Elizabeth <Elizabeth.Eveland@oregonstate.edu> <mailto:Elizabeth.Eveland@oregonstate.edu> \r\n\tSubject:  travel planning\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tGreetings, traveler,\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tI hear you’re are interested in exploring Eastern Europe with our group. Recently the group is wondering whether or not it is safe to travel right now. We need to do some research and see what we can find out.\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tThe plan is to land in Istanbul. Next, we will be traveling to Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria.  After Sofia, the next step is some car travel to Macedonia and then onwards to Albania. Our last stop will be Tirana, in Albania.\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tThe group would like to have some information sent to me to start this travel planning out:\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tA quick overview of each country’s political climate - I don’t want anyone getting into trouble and having this turn into some geopolitical affair! Is the country at war with a US ally? Is the country in political turmoil? Is there a US embassy? Is it safe to travel there now?\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tThis will be a good start for the travel planning. Please research these items and send the information to me right away.\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tKind regards,\r\n\r\n\tDavos Stark\r\n\r\n\tEastern Reaches, an OSU Travel Group"
