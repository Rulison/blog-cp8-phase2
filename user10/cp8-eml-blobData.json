Ask your doctor how to safely stop using diazepam.\r\n\r\nCall your doctor at once if you feel that this medicine is not working as well as usual, or if you think you need to use more than usual.\r\n\r\nWhile using Valium, you may need frequent blood tests at your doctor's office.\r\n\r\nStore at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light.

It is best to take Adderall first thing in the morning.\r\n\r\nDo not crush, chew, break, or open an Adderall XR extended-release capsule. Swallow it whole.\r\n\r\nTo make swallowing easier, you may open the capsule and sprinkle the medicine into a spoonful of applesauce. Swallow right away without chewing. Do not save the mixture for later use.\r\n\r\nWhile using Adderall, your doctor will need to check your progress at regular visits. Your heart rate, blood pressure, height and weight may also need to be checked often.\r\n\r\nAdderall can cause unusual results with certain medical tests. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using this medicine.\r\n\r\nStore at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light.\r\n\r\nKeep track of the amount of medicine used from each new bottle. Adderall is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please go to this link: https://www.drugs.com/adderall.html\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor Valium,\r\n\r\nTake Valium exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose to make sure you get the best results. Do not take this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.\r\n\r\nValium may be habit-forming. Misuse of habit-forming medicine can cause addiction, overdose, or death. Selling or giving away this medicine is against the law.\r\n\r\nMeasure liquid medicine with the dosing syringe provided, or with a special dose-measuring spoon or medicine cup. If you do not have a dose-measuring device, ask your pharmacist for one.\r\n\r\nValium should be used for only a short time. Do not take this medicine for longer than 4 months without your doctor's advice.\r\n\r\nDo not stop using Valium suddenly, or you could have increased seizures or unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using diazepam.\r\n\r\nCall your doctor at once if you feel that this medicine is not working as well as usual, or if you think you need to use more than usual.\r\n\r\nWhile using Valium, you may need frequent blood tests at your doctor's office.\r\n\r\nStore at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light. After you have stopped using this medicine, flush any unused pills down the toilet.\r\n\r\nKeep track of the amount of medicine used from each new bottle. Valium is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.drugs.com/valium.html\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: Stark, Davos \r\nSent: Saturday, September 10, 2016 4:17 PM\r\nTo: Eveland, Elizabeth <Elizabeth.Eveland@oregonstate.edu <mailto:Elizabeth.Eveland@oregonstate.edu> >\r\nSubject:  check on medication\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI heard from a friend that you are the one to talk to about this subject.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my friend has to take two strong medications together - Adderall, and Valium.
