I just don’t know what would be good. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI’m a big fan of action dramas such as House of Cards and Homeland (all of which I’ve already seen, unfortunately). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat’s the next best show after these three? I don’t want to be fooled into watching something bad, so please see if the critics agree that the show is really excellent. Some rankings would also help give me confidence the show will be worthwhile.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you so much! \r\n\r\n\r\nMelisandre"
