Next, we will be traveling to Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria.  After Sofia, the next step is some car travel to Macedonia and then onwards to Albania. Our last stop will be Tirana, in Albania.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe group would like to have some information sent to me to start this travel planning out:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA quick overview of each country’s political climate - I don’t want anyone getting into trouble and having this turn into some geopolitical affair! Is the country at war with a US ally? Is the country in political turmoil? Is there a US embassy? Is it safe to travel there now?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis will be a good start for the travel planning. Please research these items and send the information to me right away.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nDavos Stark\r\n\r\nEastern Reaches, an OSU Travel Group"
