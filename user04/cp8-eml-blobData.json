Acidic foods and vitamin c supplements should be taken in moderation when taking Adderall to avoid digestive system damage.  Additionally, it is bad for the cardiovascular and respiratory systems to take additional stimulants like caffeine in large doses while on Adderall (source: http://www.livestrong.com/article/322871-foods-to-avoid-when-taking-adderall).  Avoid ingesting any alcohol when on valium (source:    http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-11116/valium-oral/details/list-interaction-food).  I hope your friend doesn’t have to take these meds for much longer.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n-Chuck  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom: Stark, Davos \r\nSent: Wednesday, September 14, 2016 4:20 PM\r\nTo: Chatsworth, Charles <Charles.Chatsworth@oregonstate.edu <mailto:Charles.Chatsworth@oregonstate.edu> >\r\nSubject:  check on medication\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI heard from a friend that you are the one to talk to about this subject.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my friend has to take two strong medications together - Adderall, and Valium. Are there any issues (contraindications) with taking them both together? Is there anything (food, activities, etc.) that he needs to avoid? I just want him to be safe. Please send a list of what you find, along with links to your resources.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks for volunteering to check it out!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDavos"
