Recently the group is wondering whether or not it is safe to travel right now. We need to do some research and see what we can find out.\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tThe plan is to land in Istanbul. Next, we will be traveling to Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria.  After Sofia, the next step is some car travel to Macedonia and then onwards to Albania. Our last stop will be Tirana, in Albania.\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tThe group would like to have some information sent to me to start this travel planning out:\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tA quick overview of each country’s political climate - I don’t want anyone getting into trouble and having this turn into some geopolitical affair! Is the country at war with a US ally? Is the country in political turmoil? Is there a US embassy? Is it safe to travel there now?\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tThis will be a good start for the travel planning. Please research these items and send the information to me right away.\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tKind regards,\r\n\r\n\tDavos Stark\r\n\r\n\tEastern Reaches, an OSU Travel Group"
