Are there any issues (contraindications) with taking them both together? Is there anything (food, activities, etc.) that he needs to avoid? I just want him to be safe. Please send a list of what you find, along with links to your resources.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks for volunteering to check it out!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDavos"
